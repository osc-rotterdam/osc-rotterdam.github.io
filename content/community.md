<p>The <b>Open Science Community Rotterdam (OSCR)</b> aims to promote Open Science practices, by creating spaces of learning and knowledge exchange. We also aim to contribute to institutional change by creating a cohesive voice to advocate for open science within our institutions and the recognition of those who practice it. </p>
<p>Our community understands <b>openness</b>, <b>transparency</b>, <b>reproducibility</b>, and <b>inclusivity</b> in all stages of the research process as a path towards increasing scientific and societal impact, by producing knowledge that is just, equitable, and rigorous. </p>
<p>We welcome diverse understandings of open science, and we provide a platform for our members to respectfully discuss different points of view. We actively search for convergence with actors both within the university and beyond, who seek to produce positive change in the research system. </p>
<p>The OSCR is open to anyone who is interested in open science, regardless of experience or career stage, and who is based at Erasmus University Rotterdam or Erasmus Medical Centre. By joining the OSCR, members can meet other Open Science enthusiasts, exchange knowledge in both virtual and in-person spaces, organize their own Open Science activities with other members and the support of our coordinators, as well as be part of a wider national and international network of Open Science communities.</p>
