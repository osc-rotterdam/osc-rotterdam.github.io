<p>Research misconduct, such as fabrication, is a blatant violation of research integrity but uncommon. Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), on the other hand, are more common, pose less clear-cut ethical situations, and could nonetheless hamper the validity and trustworthiness of science. In this session, we will talk about possible QPRs in different stages of the research process, such as study design, data collection, and report writing. We will also go through some common situations that researchers face and how QRPs may arise in such situations. Possible ways of detecting and preventing QRPs in your research will be discussed.</p>
