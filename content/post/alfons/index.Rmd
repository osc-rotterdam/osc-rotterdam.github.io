# Description

My research is focused on the development of statistical methods that are robust to outliers and deviations from model assumptions. I further have an interest in machine learning techniques, as well as applications in the social and behavioral sciences. I believe that robust methods are essential for reliable and replicable findings in empirical research, since they prevent that results are driven by a small number of influential observations. As a strong supporter of open source software, I have always made the code for my developed methods publicly available. Moreover, I now make all code available for reproducing the simulation experiments and empirical examples in my publications.
