<p>Since the beginning of the new year, Erasmus University Rotterdam offers extended support for research data management (RDM). A newly appointed team of Data Stewards is working together to assist researchers with the implementation of best practices of RDM across all schools at EUR.</p>
<div id="who-are-we" class="section level2">
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p><a href="mailto:arlinghaus@eur.nl">Nils Arlinghaus</a> will be the dedicated data steward for the Erasmus School of Philosophy and the Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication. Additionally, he will work for Erasmus Research Services.</p>

<div id="what-do-we-do" class="section level2">
<h2>What do we do?</h2>
<p>We can provide support and advice with:</p>
<ul>
<li>data management plans (DMPs)</li>
<li>RDM tools and storage solutions</li>
<li>file handling (formats, naming conventions, versioning, and documentation)</li>
<li>help researchers make your data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) â€“ an important step in promoting Open Science practices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are curious or unsure</strong> about what DMP is and how it might be relevant to your research, you are in luck! We will give an overview of our services at the EUR Research Funding Days next week and there are still spaces available. You can <a href="https://eur-rfd.iseated.com/session/57656"><strong>sign up</strong></a> for our session on <strong>Wednesday, 27 January at 13:30 CET</strong>.</p>
<p>We hope to see many of you there, and if you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>Nils Arlinghaus, Anna Volkova, Liz Guzman-Ramirez, and Antonio Schettino</p>
