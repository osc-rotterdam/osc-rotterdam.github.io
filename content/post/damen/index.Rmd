# Description

After completing a bachelor in Cultural Anthropology (VU University Amsterdam) and the research master Migration, Ethnic Relations and Multiculturalism (University of Utrecht), Roxy started her PhD research. Her PhD project is about early integration among recently arrived refugees in the Netherlands (with a residence permit) and focusses mainly on Syrian permit holders as they form the largest group of recent arrivals. More specifically, her research is part of the ‘longitudinal cohort study asylum seekers and permit holders’, a collaboration between research institutes [SCP](https://english.scp.nl/), [WODC](https://www.wodc.nl/), [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/) and [CBS](https://www.cbs.nl/). In her PhD project she combines quantitative and qualitative methods. The aim is to map the process of the (socio-economic and socio-cultural) integration starting from an early stage, monitor changes in those positions over time and examine relationships between the different dimensions of refugee integration.
