<p>Are you curious to hear about what can go wrong in science, but more importantly what we can do to improve our current scientific practice? In this talk, after a brief reminder on the credibility revolution, we will explain what open research is and what it can do for you, but also for the scientific community at large. Lastly, we will specifically focus on two open research practices which are key to achieving better scientific output when testing hypotheses: Preregistration and Registered Reports.</p>
