<h1>Description</h1>
<p>My name is Daan and I have started as a PhD Candidate in Value-Based Organizing at the Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM) in 2021.</p>
<p>My research interest lies in how we can develop sustainable organizations, sustainably. This includes academic fields such as organizational sustainability, values and purpose management, and organizational change. I am mostly interested in investigating this research interest through mixed-methods or qualitative research.</p>
<p>My current involvement in open science is non-existent. I have no academic track record to speak of, nor have I had the opportunity yet to share my academic work. I have, however, worked on very practical research projects where I have been able to translate the research findings to actionable insights for the various stakeholders involved. I have done so through workshops, field manuals, and other written pieces.</p>
<p>I am a wholehearted proponent of open science practices and I am curious to learn more about how I, as a qualitative researcher, can set future-proof standards for my research and contribute to the ongoing dialogue of how we can do good research for better purposes.</p>
