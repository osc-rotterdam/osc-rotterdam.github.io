The seventh [**OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club**](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/) will take place on **May 13th** at **11:00**. The discussants will be [Elisabet Blok](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/02/blok/) and [Lorenza Dall'Aglio](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/02/dallaglio/), PhD Candidates at Erasmus MC and co-founders of the [Rotterdam R.I.O.T.S. Club](https://rdam-riot-science-club.github.io/) (with which the OSCR has a [synergic collaboration](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/03/oscr-riots/)).   
We will talk about the following paper[^1]:

> Crüwell, S., van Doorn, J., Etz, A., Makel, M. C., Moshontz, H., Niebaum, J. C., Orben, A., Parsons, S., & Schulte-Mecklenbeck, M. (2019). Seven Easy Steps to Open Science: An Annotated Reading List. Zeitschrift Für Psychologie, 227(4), 237–248. https://doi.org/10.1027/2151-2604/a000387

Open Science is an umbrella term capturing several concepts considered fundamental features of science. However, when talking about open science, many researchers immediately think of one aspect that they are familiar with (e.g., ‘data sharing’ or ‘preregistration’). With the Open Science movement rapidly changing the scientific landscape, this paper provides an useful introduction to open science and its key concepts. It highlights seven topics: (1) understanding open science; (2) open access; (3) open data, materials, and code; (4) reproducible analyses; (5) preregistration and registered reports; (6) replication research; and (7) teaching open science.   
   
We believe this paper is interesting for researchers who want to understand what open science encompasses and want to acquire key concepts or update their knowledge in the field. The ultimate goal is to enable researchers to implement or improve the way they use open science practices.

An invitation via *Outlook* calendar has been sent to researchers in the OSCR ReproducibiliTea mailing list. This email includes a link to join the meeting remotely using [**Zoom**](https://zoom.us/), a popular online conferencing service. Click on the link, insert the password provided in the invitation mail, and you will join the call. 

During the Zoom meeting, please follow these guidelines:

  - write down your question in the chat and the moderator will read it
* avoid talking over each other and make sure that everyone can have their opportunity to speak
* arrive 5 minutes before the beginning of the call, to familiarize with the online environment and solve possible technical issues

If you are not part of the ReproducibiliTea mailing list but would like to join the call, please contact [Antonio](mailto:schettino@eur.nl).

Please remember that attendees of every OSCR event (in-person or online) are required to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/coc/).

## Next Meeting
