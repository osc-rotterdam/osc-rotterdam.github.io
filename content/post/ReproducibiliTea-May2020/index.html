The discussants will be <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/02/blok/">Elisabet Blok</a> and <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/02/dallaglio/">Lorenza Dall’Aglio</a>, PhD Candidates at Erasmus MC and co-founders of the <a href="https://rdam-riot-science-club.github.io/">Rotterdam R.I.O.T.S. Club</a> (with which the OSCR has a <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/03/oscr-riots/">synergic collaboration</a>).<br />
We will talk about the following paper<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>

<p>Open Science is an umbrella term capturing several concepts considered fundamental features of science. However, when talking about open science, many researchers immediately think of one aspect that they are familiar with (e.g., ‘data sharing’ or ‘preregistration’). With the Open Science movement rapidly changing the scientific landscape, this paper provides an useful introduction to open science and its key concepts. It highlights seven topics: (1) understanding open science; (2) open access; (3) open data, materials, and code; (4) reproducible analyses; (5) preregistration and registered reports; (6) replication research; and (7) teaching open science.</p>
<p>We believe this paper is interesting for researchers who want to understand what open science encompasses and want to acquire key concepts or update their knowledge in the field. The ultimate goal is to enable researchers to implement or improve the way they use open science practices.</p>
