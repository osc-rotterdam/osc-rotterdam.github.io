<h1>Description</h1>
<p>I am part of a small faculty with a close-knit team of support staff. Because the faculty is so small, my position is difficult to encapsulate in an unambiguous title. My main activities consist of solicited and unsolicited advice on all matters relating to (scientific) communication to external and internal parties. Organizing events to recruit students and events aimed at publicizing the research results of our esteemed philosophers. I also try to facilitate a lively alumni community and when there is an inch of time left, I am the contact person for press requests.</p>
<p>I have many ideas and little time, but making academic output more transparent and accessible is something that requires time. I am happy to think along about how disciplines that primarily are in the business of qualitative research – or more so have methods as such, as subject of their research, can be part of a more transparent and open academic culture.</p>
