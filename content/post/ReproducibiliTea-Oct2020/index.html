<p>The eleventh <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/"><strong>OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club</strong></a> will take place on <strong>October 28th</strong> at <strong>15:00</strong>. The discussant will be <a href="https://naoyukisunami.com/">Naoyuki Sunami</a>, PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.udel.edu/">University of Delaware</a>. Nami will talk about the following paper<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gelman, A., &amp; Loken, E. (2013). The garden of forking paths: Why multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no “fishing expedition” or “p-hacking” and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time. Columbia Statistics. <a href="https://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf" class="uri">https://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we think about <em>p</em>-hacking, we often picture researchers performing tests repeatedly and report the ones that “worked” (<em>p</em> &lt; .05). However, researchers can unintentionally increase researcher degrees of freedom by other data-dependent decisions. This paper warns us of the garden of forking paths in data exclusion, coding, and analysis, and how these decisions prevent us from interpreting <em>p</em>-values at their face value.</p>
<p>Attendees will be encouraged to talk about their own gardens of forking paths, their implications to reproducibility, and how we can move forward.</p>
