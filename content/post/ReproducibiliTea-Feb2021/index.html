<p>The thirteenth <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/"><strong>OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club</strong></a> will take place on <strong>February 11th</strong> at <strong>14:00</strong>. Our special guest will be <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/people/rolf-zwaan">Prof. Dr. Rolf Zwaan</a>, professor of Biological and Cognitive Psychology at the <a href="https://www.erim.eur.nl/research-support/erasmus-behavioural-lab-ebl/research-groups/psychology-iop/">Institute of Psychology</a> and Chair of the <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/essb/research/lab-society/research-programme-psychology/brain-and-cognition">Brain and Cognition area</a> at Erasmus University Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Rolf will guide us through one of his most influential papers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zwaan, R. A., Etz, A., Lucas, R. E., &amp; Donnellan, M. B. (2018). Making replication mainstream. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 41, e120. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001972" class="uri">http://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001972</a></p>

<p>In this article, the authors describe the role of replication in science. A single finding is not very meaningful. Having a procedure that reliably produces a finding is. Direct replication is a tool by which reliability can be assessed. In the article, the authors discuss several arguments that have been leveled in the literature against direct replication, concluding that these arguments provide no obstacles to make (direct) replication mainstream.</p>
<p><em>Making Replication Mainstream</em> signifies the performative nature of the article. It not only describes ways in which replication can become mainstream but is also intended to <em>help</em> bring about what it describes. With this goal in mind, the authors submitted our manuscript to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences">Behavioral and Brain Sciences</a> (BBS), a journal with a broad audience, which may not have been familiar with the replication debate. Another attractive feature of BBS is that it allows for commentaries, which help broaden the scope of the arguments. The authors were pleased (though initially a little dismayed and intimidated) that the article elicited <em>36</em> commentaries. Fortunately, these commentaries were largely supportive and helped more clearly map the role of replication in psychological and brain science.</p>
