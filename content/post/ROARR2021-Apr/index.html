<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2021/01/12/roarr-2021/">ROARR2021 programme</a> – a wonderful collaboration between OSCR and the <a href="https://www.riotsciencenl.com/">Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club</a> – we will host an online workshop entitled <strong>Introduction to the Open Science Framework</strong>. Below the announcement:</p>
<p><strong>WHAT</strong><br />
Introduction to the Open Science Framework.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN</strong><br />
April 14th 2021 h. 14:00 CEST, duration 90’.</p>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTOR</strong><br />
<a href="https://antonio-schettino.com/">Dr. Antonio Schettino</a>, experimental psychologist with a background in cognitive and affective electrophysiology, Coordinator Open Science at <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/research/research-services">Erasmus Research Services</a> and founder of the Open Science Community Rotterdam.</p>
<p><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE</strong><br />
Researchers from all disciplines and career stages who wish to learn how to use the Open Science Framework for their own work.</p>
<p><strong>WORKSHOP SUMMARY</strong><br />
To promote transparency and trustworthiness of research, an increasing number of <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-data-management">funding agencies</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aab2374">journals</a> encourage or require data, materials, and analysis scripts associated with each publication. Consequently, researchers are turning to comprehensive services that facilitate collaborative workflows with colleagues and evaluators. One of the most popular is the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> (OSF), a free online platform developed by the non-profit organization <a href="https://www.cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a>. The OSF allows researchers to manage, document, and share all the products of their workflow, from the preregistration of the initial idea to the preprint of the final report.</p>
