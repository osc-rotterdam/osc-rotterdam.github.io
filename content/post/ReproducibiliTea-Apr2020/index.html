<p>The worldwide spread of the <em>SARS-CoV-2</em> virus – and subsequent increase in people affected by <em>COVID-19</em> – is causing noticeable disruptions in our regular lifestyle. However, we are doing our best to translate OSCR initiatives online, not only to continue our mission to increase awareness on open science practices but also provide valuable support and human connection during this period of (self-)isolation.</p>
<p>One of our first online events will be the sixth <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/"><strong>OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club</strong></a>, which will take place on <strong>April 8th</strong> at <strong>11:00</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. We will have a special guest: <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/anne-m-scheel"><strong>Anne Scheel</strong></a>, Doctoral Candidate at the <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/department-of-industrial-engineering-innovation-sciences">Department of Industrial Engineering &amp; Innovation Sciences</a>, <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/human-technology-interaction">Human Technology Interaction</a>, <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>. Anne studied psychology at <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en">Heidelberg University</a> and psychological research methods at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/">University of Glasgow</a>, and worked in a developmental psychology lab at <a href="https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich</a> for two years. Her background is in infant research but, since she first learned about the “replication crisis” in psychology, she devoted more and more time to follow the discussions around ways to make research more transparent and reproducible. Eventually this led her to switch tracks and turn to meta-science as main research focus: in October 2017, she started her PhD in <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/daniel-lakens/">Daniël Lakens’</a> project <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/human-technology-interaction/projects/improving-the-reliability-and-efficiency-of-psychological-science/"><strong>Increasing the reliability and efficiency of psychological science</strong></a> in Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Anne will guide us through her latest preprint<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>

<p>Registered Reports<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> are designed to prevent a host of biases from distorting the evidence that makes it into the published literature. The format makes it much harder for authors to use questionable research practices such as <em>p</em>-hacking or HARKing, and it makes it much harder for reviewers and editors to block negative results from publication. Because Registered Reports appear to be such a powerful tool against bias, and since the format has gained a lot of popularity in a short time, a straightforward question to ask is how the results reported in published Registered Reports compare to those in the standard literature. This paper investigates the question by replicating a method by <a href="http://danielefanelli.com/aboutMe.html">Daniele Fanelli</a> – who reported that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010068">91.5% of psychology papers find support for their first hypothesis</a> – on a random sample of “standard” hypothesis-testing articles and all available Registered Reports in psychology. The results are <strong>96%</strong> positive results in standard psychology articles compared to only <strong>44%</strong> in Registered Reports (for similar results, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000246">this <em>Perspective</em> paper in <em>PLOS Biology</em></a>). The paper discusses several limitations of this retrospective observational approach, in particular that important <em>a priori</em> differences might exist between the standard articles and the Registered Reports in the sample. Anne and her co-authors further present a qualitative analysis of the language used to describe hypotheses in Registered Reports, showing a surprising amount of variation and some notable differences between replication studies and original work which might be of interest to other meta-researchers.</p>
