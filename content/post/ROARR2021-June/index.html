<p>Researchers are weighed and measured in no small part on their publication track record. Scientific publishing, however, has drawn much criticism particularly in recent years, with many considering it a gameable system far removed from its intended purpose: to disseminate and comment on the merit of scientific research. In this talk, we will hear an overview of the longstanding and more recent issues in scientific publishing before moving on to offering alternatives and solutions, some of which can be readily incorporated into a researcher’s day-to-day workflow.</p>
<p>This talk will be given by <a href="https://twitter.com/westwoodsam1">Dr. Samuel Westwood</a>, lecturer in Psychology at the University of Wolverhampton and a visiting lecturer at the Social Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre at King’s College London. His research interests span psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, and meta-science (or “research-on-research”). His primary research seeks to understand brain structure-function relationships, but in recent years he has investigated the quality and rigour of research in psychiatry. He is the founder of two initiatives that promote awareness and provide training in open research: the <a href="http://riotscience.co.uk/about-us/">R.I.O.T. Science Club</a> and the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/kings-open-research-group-initiative-korgi">King’s Open Research Group Initiative</a> (KORGI). He is also the co-local network lead for the <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/">UK Reproducibility Network</a> at the University of Wolverhampton.</p>
