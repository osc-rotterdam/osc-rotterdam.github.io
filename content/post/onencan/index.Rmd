# Description

I study industrial environmental harms, specifically those resulting from the production and use of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). These synthetic chemical substances resist degradation, resulting in unprecedented persistence into the environment and in any living species. My research combines green-critical criminological, environmental philosophical and public health approaches to examine the historical and contemporary drivers and dynamics of the industrial environmental harms related to these synthetic chemical substances. As a member of the multidisciplinary research team of Erasmus Initiative on Dynamics of Inclusive Prosperity, I am curious to find innovative solutions to environmental degradation by PFAS, where companies, governments, and communities can jointly improve existing governance frameworks for more inclusive prosperity. Since my research work is trans-disciplinary, I strive to reach diverse groups of people by actively adopting Open Science and FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) guiding principles in all my research practices.
