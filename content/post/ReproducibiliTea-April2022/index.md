The eighteenth [**OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club**](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/21/oscr-reproducibilitea/) will take place on **April 7th at 14:00 CEST**. Our special guests will be [Prof. Lex Bouter](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/lex-bouter), Professor of Methodology and Integrity at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and [Prof. Rik Peels](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/rik-peels), Associate Professor in Philosophy and Religion & Theology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Rik and Lex will guide us through one of their papers[^1]:

> Bouter L., & Peels R. (2021). Replication and trustworthiness. Accountability in Research, 1-10. https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2021.1963708

In this paper, the authors explore multiple relations that exist between trustworthiness and replication. When “trust”, “trustworthiness”, “replicability”, “replication study”, and “successful replication” are defined, the authors review the relation of trustworthiness to each of the three main kinds of replication: reproductions, direct replications, and conceptual replications. Thereafter, they discuss the relation of trustworthiness to the intentionality of a replication. Following, the authors explore whether the trustworthiness of research findings depends merely on evidential considerations or also on what is at stake.
