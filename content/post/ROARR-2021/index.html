<p>We are delighted to announce that, in 2021, we will organize the <strong>Rotterdam Open And Reproducible Research</strong> (<strong>ROARR</strong>) programme in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.riotsciencenl.com/">Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club</a>. Within the ROARR programme, researchers from different fields will give introductory lectures and practical sessions on open research along the research cycle: from how pre-registration and registered reports aid our hypothesis testing to how publishing can be reimagined in an open research culture.</p>
