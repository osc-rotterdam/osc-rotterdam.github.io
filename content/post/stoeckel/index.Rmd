# Description

I am a PhD candidate in Health Economics at the Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management with a background in Economics (BSc at the University of Mannheim and MSc at the KU Leuven) and political science (MA at the KU Leuven). My research is funded by the [Erasmus Initiative Smarter Choices for Better Health](https://www.eur.nl/en/research/erasmus-initiatives/smarter-choices-better-health) at the Erasmus University Rotterdam.

In my research I use different types of large observational datasets -- such as cross-sectional or longitudinal general population surveys -- as well as administrative data, which I analyze using econometric techniques aimed at causal inference. In most cases these datasets are only accessible after signing a binding confidentiality agreement. While I am a great enthusiast of open science, this circumstance often prohibits me from making the data used in my research projects available to the public. I have tried to make up for this by creating reproducible research materials that can re-create the entire project workflow from raw data to published results conditional on obtaining access to the original data.

By joining OSCR I hope to learn more about open science areas I have not yet been involved in myself, to further improve the reproducibility of my ongoing projects and share my experiences with implementing open science principles when not all parts of a research project can be shared.
