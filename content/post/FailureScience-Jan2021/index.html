<p>The winter holidays are over, but fear not! OSCR comes back from a well-deserved break with the webinar <strong>Discussing Failures in Science</strong>. Following up a previous <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/01/reproducibilitea-feb2020/">OSCR ReproducibiliTea</a> talk, the <a href="https://www.jtrialerror.com/">Journal of Trial and Error</a> (JOTE) returns to discuss the importance of recognizing and discussing failure in science.</p>
<p>Co-founder and Editor-in-Chief, <strong>Stefan Gaillard</strong>, is joined by JOTE’s editor of psychology, <strong>Sean Devine</strong>, and author, <strong>Kristel De Groot</strong>, to discuss the journal’s first issue and the role failure should play in the Open Science community more broadly. In their talk, they will describe their unique experiences with the journal, each from a different perspective: Stefan as a co-founder, Sean as an editor, and Kristel as a contributing author. Throughout the course of their talk, they will try to answer questions like: Why are scientists so hesitant to share their nonsignificant or unexpected findings? What failures contribute to the literature and which ones do not? Who bears the lion’s share of responsibility for the abundance of positive publication bias in the literature? Journals? Editors? Scientists? Are we all to blame? Or no one? More importantly, how do we fix it? The answer to this question, they propose, are platforms that publish negative results in combination with historical, philosophical, and meta-scientific reflection; one example of such a platform would be a scholarly journal that embraces trial and error. Based on each speaker’s experience with JOTE’s first issue, Stefan, Sean, and Kristel will share their thoughts on the benefits and drawbacks of such a novel platform.</p>
<p>Kristel’s first article in JOTE can be read here, as part of the journal’s first issue:</p>
