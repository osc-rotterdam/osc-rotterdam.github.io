My name is Eirini Botsari and I am from Athens, Greece. From a very young age I would get lost in novel books that explored relationships and canvassed the human psyche. Growing up and through my life and work experiences, I came to one conclusion: 

> “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.”   
> Ryunosuke Satoro

If you were to [take a look at my CV](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2021/12/01/botsari/), you would see that I studied in London and Leiden, and that for the past 10 years I have had different jobs. However, there is one thing in common that connects their apparent diversity, which is one of my most important values: **human connection and interaction**. Stemming from this, I truly believe that we, as humans, are social beings, and only together can we develop and move forward. This point of view is compatible with the mission and vision of open science, which stands for openness, transparency, and connection, values that I hold high. 

I am more than thrilled to be on this journey with all of you. As Community Manager, I organize events on open science practices, discuss and promote these activities on social media, and support and facilitate open science in our community.

Besides that, I also have my own practice as a psychologist in Leiden. In my free time, I like to draw, climb, and scratch my guitar strings. I have a dog from whom I learn acceptance and loyalty. One of my most favorite things is cooking and gathering with friends to enjoy food and conversation.

I want to state that my door is always open and that I would be more than happy to welcome you if you have any questions, topics that you would like to discuss, or any other concerns or conversations you might want to have.
