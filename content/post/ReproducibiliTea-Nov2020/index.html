<p>The twelfth <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/"><strong>OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club</strong></a> will take place on <strong>November 25th</strong> at <strong>11:00</strong>. The discussant will be <a href="https://lorenzada.github.io/">Lorenza Dall’Aglio</a>, PhD candidate at Erasmus MC, <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/02/dallaglio/">OSCR member</a>, and co-funder of <a href="https://rdam-riot-science-club.github.io/">Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club</a>. Lorenza will talk about the following preprint<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Protzko, J., Krosnick, J., Nelson, L. D., Nosek, B. A., Axt, J., Berent, M., … Schooler, J. (2020, September 10). High Replicability of Newly-Discovered Social-behavioral Findings is Achievable. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/n2a9x" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/n2a9x</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The replication crisis has brought to light the use of suboptimal and questionable research practices in science, including in the social-behavioral field (e.g., lack of transparency, p-hacking, low power). To overcome such issues, open research practices such as pre-registration have been repeatedly suggested. However, are social-behavioral findings replicable once open research practices are implemented? Or is low replicability inevitable in the social-behavioral sciences? Protzko et al. (2020) tried to answer these questions. They argue that successful replication of social-behavioral findings is achievable, and showed high replication rates for 16 studies, which were preregistered, well-powered, and transparently reported. Finally, some really good news for science and the open research community!</p>
