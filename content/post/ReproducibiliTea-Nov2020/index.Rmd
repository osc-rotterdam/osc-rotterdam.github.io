The twelfth [**OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club**](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/) will take place on **November 25th** at **11:00**. The discussant will be [Lorenza Dall'Aglio](https://lorenzada.github.io/), PhD candidate at Erasmus MC, [OSCR member](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/02/dallaglio/), and co-funder of [Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club](https://rdam-riot-science-club.github.io/). Lorenza will talk about the following preprint[^1]: 

> Protzko, J., Krosnick, J., Nelson, L. D., Nosek, B. A., Axt, J., Berent, M., … Schooler, J. (2020, September 10). High Replicability of Newly-Discovered Social-behavioral Findings is Achievable. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/n2a9x

The replication crisis has brought to light the use of suboptimal and questionable research practices in science, including in the social-behavioral field (e.g., lack of transparency, p-hacking, low power). To overcome such issues, open research practices such as pre-registration have been repeatedly suggested. However, are social-behavioral findings replicable once open research practices are implemented? Or is low replicability inevitable in the social-behavioral sciences? Protzko et al. (2020) tried to answer these questions. They argue that successful replication of social-behavioral findings is achievable, and showed high replication rates for 16 studies, which were preregistered, well-powered, and transparently reported. Finally, some really good news for science and the open research community!

An invitation via *Outlook* calendar has been sent to researchers in the OSCR mailing list[^2]. This email includes a link to join the meeting remotely using [**Zoom**](https://zoom.us/). Click on the link, insert the password provided in the invitation mail, and you will join the call.

During the Zoom meeting, please follow these guidelines:

* wear headphones
* mute your microphone
* video is optional (in case of connection issues, you may be asked to turn it off)
* pay attention to the moderator (which will be **Antonio**)
* if you have questions
  - click on the **Raise Hand** button and the moderator will unmute you; or
  - write down your question in the chat and the moderator will read it
* avoid talking over each other and make sure that everyone can have their opportunity to speak
* arrive a few minutes before the beginning of the call, to familiarize with the online environment and solve possible technical issues

Please remember that attendees of every OSCR event (in-person or online) are required to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/coc/).

Take care,

Lorenza Dall'Aglio and Antonio Schettino
