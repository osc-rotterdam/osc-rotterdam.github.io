# Description

My current research focuses on the development of predictive and prescriptive analytics to address key business decisions. I am particularly interested in the design of new methodologies that can guide organizations in their customer-centric decision making. My research portfolio has been organized according to the three fundamental stages of the customer lifecycle: (i) customer acquisition and new product introduction, (ii) customer development and engagement, and (iii) customer retention. A substantial part of my research involves machine learning and large-scale cluster and grid computing. At the moment, I am working making all my codes public and create R packages to promote their use among academics, but particularly companies. One of my ambitions w.r.t. open science is to get companies on board and help them getting access to the best academic work in their daily practices.
