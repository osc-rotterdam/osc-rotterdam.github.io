# Description

I study parental lying and its effect on children. Hereby, I focus on exploring the (potential) discrepancy between parental attitudes towards lying, their lying behavior, and what they teach their child(ren) about lying and honesty. Specifically, I'm interested to investigate which parents express such discrepancies and how this relates to child outcomes, such as child's lying and their social-emotional and behavioral development.
