<p>A researcher has to make many choices when analyzing data. Examples of these choices are which analysis method to use, which covariates to include, and what to do with outliers in the data. In this talk, we will take a closer look at this flexibility, the consequences of this flexibility on statistical results, and how we can limit the influence of this flexibility.</p>
<p>This talk will be given by <a href="http://www.marjanbakker.eu/">Dr. Marjan Bakker</a>, assistant professor at Tilburg University at the methodology and statistics department and part of the <a href="https://metaresearch.nl/">meta-research group</a>. Her research interests include scientific integrity, errors in statistics, statistical power, publication bias, psychometrics, preregistration, and game theory. Dr. Bakker contributed to the discussion on the credibility revolution in psychological science with her PhD work entitled <a href="https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=ed0c89aa-8bf3-48d1-9191-f3dee565140e">Good science, bad science: Questioning research practices in psychological research</a>.</p>
