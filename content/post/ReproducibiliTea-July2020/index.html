<p>The ninth <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/"><strong>OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club</strong></a> will take place on <strong>July 8th</strong> at <strong>14:00</strong>. This is a special one, because it is a combined session between OSCR and <a href="https://rdam-riot-science-club.github.io/">Rotterdam R.I.O.T.S.</a>. More information on this wonderful partnership can be found on <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/03/oscr-riots/">this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The discussant will be <a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/sophia/research/researchers/white-tonya">Prof. Dr. Tonya White</a> from the <a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/sophia/research/departments-and-centers/child-psychiatry">Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</a> and the <a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/departments/radiology-and-nuclear-medicine">Department of Radiology &amp; Nuclear Medicine</a> at Erasmus MC.</p>
<p>Tonya will discuss her work on multiple testing correction<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White, T., van der Ende, J. &amp; Nichols, T.E. Beyond Bonferroni revisited: concerns over inflated false positive research findings in the fields of conservation genetics, biology, and medicine. Conserv Genet 20, 927–937 (2019). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-019-01178-0" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-019-01178-0</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With increasingly large datasets, we as researchers are able to test many hypotheses. However, with the testing of an increasing number of hypotheses, comes an increased chance of having a significant finding by chance alone. False positives are termed <em>Type I</em> errors, where the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. When testing for multiple hypotheses, we can correct our <em>p</em>-values so that the number of Type I errors does not increase with the number of hypotheses tested. There are different approaches to apply multiple testing correction, depending on the nature of the data.</p>
<p>During this session Tonya will share her story of how she came across an error in a methodological paper on multiple testing correction. The paper had been cited over 600 times and presented an error in an equation attributed to the Benjamini and Yekutieli procedure for multiple testing correction. She will explain how differences in the equation posed in the paper and in the original equation led to differences in how stringent the correction applied was. She will then more broadly cover different types of multiple testing correction and when they can be applied. We will end the session focusing on two points. First, she will invite participants to think together about examples and which forms of multiple testing correction would be appropriate for specific examples. Second, she will discuss how challenging it is to correct errors that have been embedded in science.</p>
