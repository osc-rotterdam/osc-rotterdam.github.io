The [Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club](https://www.riotsciencenl.com/), an [OSCR Member initiative](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/03/oscr-riots/), will host a talk entitled **R Markdown & Github: A walkthrough for sharing code and results**, part of a series of events on open research organized by the [R.I.O.T. Science Club](http://riotscience.co.uk/) global team[^1].

**WHEN**   
February 25th 2021 h. 15:00 CET, duration 60'

**INSTRUCTOR**   
[Dr. Oliver Pain](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/oliver-pain), postdoctoral research associate at the Social Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre, King’s College London. His work uses statistical genetics to understand and predict outcomes related to mental health.

**WORKSHOP SUMMARY**   
This workshop will provide an introduction to Rmarkdown websites and how to host them online using GitHub pages. Oliver will take you through a few exercises to create a Rmarkdown website online. You can find an example [here](https://opain.github.io/MDD-TWAS/).

**PREPARATION**   
For the practical, Oliver suggests using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), but he will also provide instructions using R and Git on the command line. This is best hosted on your local computer. You will also need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) and to download the [workshop materials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x_ZW5LjilAYdVmwqZzgNw2UPw6tNsssz/view) in advance.

**REGISTRATION**   
The event will be hosted via [Microsoft Teams live event](bit.ly/3ufZst2). An invitation email has also been sent via the OSCR mailing list. If you are not part of the mailing list but would like to join, please contact [Antonio](mailto:schettino@eur.nl).

Hope to see many of you!

Take care,

Oliver Pain, Lorenza Dall'Aglio, and Antonio Schettino
