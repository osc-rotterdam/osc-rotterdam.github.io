<p>The fifth OSCR <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/"><strong>ReproducibiliTea journal club</strong></a> will take place on <strong>March 11th</strong> at <strong>11:00</strong> in <strong>room G2-35</strong> (<a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/campus/locations/spaces/g-building">G building</a>).</p>
<p>We will have a special guest: <a href="https://libereurope.eu/blog/dt_team/hardy-schwamm/">Hardy Schwamm</a>, Open Scholarship Librarian at the <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/">National University of Ireland</a> and co-founder of the <a href="http://www.osc-galway.ie/">Open Scholarship Community Galway</a>. Hardy is interested in how research is evaluated and how academics are assessed when it comes to job / grant applications and promotions. Hardy believes that research assessment is a topic all researchers should have a basic knowledge of, as it will determine their careers in academia.</p>
<p>In this context, we will look at the blog post <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/introducing-scope-aprocess-for-evaluating-responsibly/"><strong>Introducing SCOPE – a process for evaluating responsibly</strong></a>, published by <a href="https://fi.linkedin.com/in/laura-himanen-851a7b1a">Laura Himanen</a> and <a href="https://about.me/elizabeth.gadd">Elizabeth Gadd</a> on <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/">The Bibliomagician</a> in December 2019. The blog post asks what universities do next, once Responsible Metrics statements such as <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a> are signed? How can we measure researchers’ outputs in a way that takes into account all the problematic aspects of research metrics? The proposed SCOPE method aims to be a step in this direction. We will go through SCOPE<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and discuss if such a method speaks to researchers and should be promoted to senior managers in universities.</p>
<p>In preparation for this meeting, have a look at the <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/introducing-scope-aprocess-for-evaluating-responsibly/">SCOPE blog post</a> and think about how research is currently evaluated at EUR and other universities you know.</p>
<p>An invitation on <em>Outlook</em> calendar has been sent to researchers in the ReproducibiliTea mailing list (if you want to be included, contact <a href="mailto:schettino@eur.nl">Antonio</a>. Please explicitly <strong>Accept</strong> or <strong>Decline</strong> the invitation, so that catering and room capacity can be evaluated accordingly.</p>
