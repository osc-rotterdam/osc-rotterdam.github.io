The fourth OSCR [**ReproducibiliTea journal club**](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/) will take place on **February 12th** at **11:00** in **room J7-55** ([Bayle building](https://www.eur.nl/en/campus/locations/spaces/bayle-building)).

We will have two special guests: [Max Bautista Perpinyà](https://twitter.com/oliviodare) and [Stefan Gaillard](https://twitter.com/sdmgaillard), two co-founders of the [Journal of Trial and Error](https://www.jtrialerror.com/). In their talk[^1], Max and Stefan will focus on the importance of publishing negative and null results, as well as other research results that would traditionally be considered "failure" such as unsuccessful chemical syntheses. They will go on to explore the questions surrounding the publication of such research. When is it useful to publish these types of results? How can scientists be convinced to share their non-significant or unexpected findings? Max and Stefan will show that the positive publication bias can only be addressed by addressing the sociotechnical system of science as a whole. They will propose a solution to this problem in the form of a platform that solely publishes negative results in combination with historical, philosophical, sociological and/or subject specific theoretical reflections. Based on their own experience with such a platform, Max and Stefan will explore the benefits and drawbacks of this novel approach.

In preparation for this meeting, we will read the Journal of Trial and Error's [manifesto](https://www.jtrialerror.com/the-manifesto-for-trial-and-error-in-science/) as well as the following paper:

> Bespalov, A., Steckler, T., & Skolnick, P. (2019). Be positive about negatives – recommendations for the publication of negative (or null) results. European Neuropsychopharmacology, 29(12), 1312–1320. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2019.10.007

Although this article seems to focus only on neuropsychopharmacology, it is actually relevant for publishing "failure" in general.

An invitation on _Outlook_ calendar has been sent to researchers in the ReproducibiliTea mailing list (if you want to be included, contact [Antonio](mailto:schettino@eur.nl)). Please explicitly **Accept** or **Decline** the invitation, so that catering and room capacity can be evaluated accordingly.

## Next Meeting

The next meeting will take place on **March 11th 2020** at **11:00** in **room G2-35** ([G building](https://www.eur.nl/en/campus/locations/spaces/g-building)). Contact [Antonio](mailto:schettino@eur.nl) to be the next discussant!

Greetings,

Max Bautista Perpinyà, Stefan Gaillard, and Antonio Schettino
