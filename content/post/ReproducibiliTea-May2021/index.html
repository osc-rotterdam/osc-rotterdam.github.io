<p>The sixteenth <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/21/oscr-reproducibilitea/"><strong>OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club</strong></a> will take place on <strong>May 19th at 11:00 CEST</strong>. Our special guest will be <a href="https://www.bramleylab.ppls.ed.ac.uk/member/aba/">Dr. Aba Szollosi</a>, postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.bramleylab.ppls.ed.ac.uk/#top">Bramley Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls">University of Edinburgh</a>.</p>
<p>Aba will guide us through one of his papers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Szollosi, A., &amp; Donkin, C. (2021). Arrested Theory Development: The Misguided Distinction Between Exploratory and Confirmatory Research. Perspectives on Psychological Science. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620966796" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620966796</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this paper, the authors argue that the exploratory-confirmatory distinction shifts the focus away from the real issues underlying replicability problems in psychology – that replication is expected on the basis of overly flexible theories, which only assert (but do not explain <em>why</em>) replication should be expected. They also argue that recently proposed method-oriented solutions based on this distinction cannot solve the issues associated with flexible theorising (or can only do so indirectly and inefficiently).</p>
<p>As an illustrative example, Aba will use a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691618755704">recent Registered Replication Report</a> of the (non-replicable) finding that people perform better on a general-knowledge quiz after they are asked to imagine themselves as university professors compared to when they imagine themselves as soccer hooligans. He will explain how and why his thinking changed on the utility of method-oriented solutions since participating in this replication effort and discuss alternative solutions to replicability problems which he now finds more useful.</p>
