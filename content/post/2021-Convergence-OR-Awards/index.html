<p>We are pleased to announce the launch of the <em>Convergence Health and Technology Open Research Awards</em>, aimed at researchers adopting open research practices in healthcare and technology.</p>
<p>Open research encompasses transparency, openness, reproducibility, and replicability, which are essential principles to achieve quality research. Pursuant to these principles, cultural change from a publish-or-perish to an open research culture is occurring, led by stakeholders such as the European Commission and the Dutch Research Council (NWO). Grassroots initiatives, such as the <a href="http://startyourosc.com/">Open Science Communities</a>, <a href="https://reproducibilitea.org/">ReproducibiliTea</a>, and <a href="http://riotscience.co.uk/">R.I.O.T. Science Club</a>, additionally provide training in the use of open research practices. However, a number of barriers remain to adopting and promoting open research principles in daily research activities. While implementing open research practices in one’s workflow requires considerable time investments, such efforts remain largely overlooked. Researchers practicing open research, however, lead behavioural change and help keep our institutions at the forefront of research in healthcare and technology. With the <em>Convergence Health and Technology Open Research Awards</em>, we hope to <strong>promote behavioural change and to reward the efforts necessary for adopting and promoting open research practices</strong> in health and technology research.</p>
<p>We offer a total of <strong>twelve awards across Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, and TU Delft</strong>, for a total of 4 awards per institution. The awards will be given to <strong>two Master students</strong> and <strong>two Early Career Researchers</strong> (PhD candidates, postdocs, research assistants/associates) per institution. Each award consists of a certificate of excellence and a monetary reward of 100 Euros.</p>
<p>Applications will open on <strong>June 21st 2021</strong> and close on <strong>August 31st 2021</strong>. Both self-nominations and nominations of other students/researchers can be submitted. We value equity and diversity; therefore, <strong>we strongly encourage applications from underrepresented minorities</strong> (e.g., gender and ethnic minorities). You can <strong>apply at <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekikGGGjhCVF-z052AnUklN3KV-_TH7MuO4EUuvI1uo6V_iQ/viewform">this link</a></strong>. Please consult our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBmTeQom70n2Iw_HT6GCQRWv6zN8LS0LLQVNvy7x_UE/edit?usp=sharing">eligibility criteria</a> before application. Because we value transparency, we have prespecified and publicly shared our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16RztntO8UTdO5ymOGrfJOU-aj9FAGbrcHj3mIQ4Egeo/edit?usp=sharing">evaluation criteria</a>. We recognise that such evaluation is mostly tailored to quantitative science and plan to extend our reach to qualitative disciplines in the upcoming years. For any questions and suggestions, please <a href="mailto:info@riotscienceNL.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Convergence Health and Technology Open Research Awards</em> are organised and offered by the <a href="https://convergence.healthandtechnology.nl/">Convergence Health and Technology</a> team, the Erasmus MC Dean Prof. Van Leeuwen, Dr. Adrian Cohen (Unit Research Policy &amp; Advice), and the <a href="https://www.riotsciencenl.com/">Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club</a>. A board of members of the <a href="http://www.riotscience.co.uk/">R.I.O.T. Science Club</a>, <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/home/">Open Science Community Rotterdam</a>, and <a href="https://osc-delft.github.io/">Open Science Community Delft</a> have contributed to the development of these awards and will evaluate applications following the pre-specified criteria.</p>
