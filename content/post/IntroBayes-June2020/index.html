<p>In the context of the ongoing debate about the replication crisis in psychology, methodologists have criticized the common practice of null-hypothesis testing using <em>p</em>-values. As a result, more and more researchers recently started using so-called Bayesian statistics to analyze their data. But what does this “new” approach to statistics really mean? What are the differences between Bayesian statistics and Frequentist statistics? What are the advantages (or disadvantages) of the estimation of the “subjective probability” of a model as compared to the usual practice to test a model based on the “objective probability” of the data under the null-hypothesis? What are the implications for our conclusions and interpretations of the results, if we switch from Frequentist to Bayesian statistics?</p>
<p><a href="http://cognitive-psychology.eu/lindemann">Dr. Oliver Lindemann</a>, Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology, Education and Child Studies at the <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/essb/">Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences</a>, will give an introduction to the basic concepts and computational principles of Bayesian parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. A Bayesian <em>t</em>-test and the calculation of Bayes factors will be illustrated using the free and easy-to-use software <a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The event will take place on <strong>June 3rd 2020</strong> at <strong>14:00 CEST</strong> and will last between 60’ and 90’<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
