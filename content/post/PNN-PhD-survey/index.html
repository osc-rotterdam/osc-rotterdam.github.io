<p>Early-career researchers constitute the core of our community: they analyze and discuss papers at journal clubs, lead talks and workshops, and implement open science practices. They are important stakeholders in the current transition to <a href="https://vsnu.nl/recognitionandrewards/recognition-and-rewards/index.html">a new academic system of recognition and rewards</a> – one that values openness and transparency and promotes alternative career pathways –, and it is important for their voices to be heard.</p>
<p>The <strong>Promovendi Netwerk Nederland</strong> (<a href="https://hetpnn.nl/en/over-pnn/">PNN</a>) is the national interest group for PhD candidates in the Netherlands. Members are the local PhD Organizations within Dutch universities, medical centers and research institutions. PNN represents PhDs in conversations with several other stakeholders, including the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (<a href="https://vsnu.nl/en_GB">VSNU</a>), the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (<a href="https://www.knaw.nl/en">KNAW</a>), the Dutch Research Council (<a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en">NWO</a>), and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (<a href="https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-education-culture-and-science">OC&amp;W</a>).</p>
<p>PNN has 8 board members with their own portfolios. Our guest, <strong>Tess van Doorn</strong>, is the board member responsible for the <a href="https://hetpnn.nl/en/open-science/">portfolio on Open Science</a>. During her talk, Tess will present the results of the <strong>PNN PhD Survey 2020</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which was conducted between March 2nd and May 10th. A total of 2,034 individuals participated, of which 1,601 PhDs completed the survey. This was the first survey that collected data on PhDs in the Netherlands on a national level. One of the subjects questioned was Open Science and Recognition and Reward. After presenting our results, the audience is invited to discuss how awareness of Open Science in PhD candidates can be enhanced and share thoughts on how this awareness can be expanded on a national basis.</p>
<p>The event will take place on <strong>February 3rd 2021</strong> at <strong>14:00 CET</strong> and will last 60’.
