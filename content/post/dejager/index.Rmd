# Description

Born and raised as a jack of all trades, I find communication between disciplines to be a crucial aspect of "openness" in science. I work primarily in philosophy, where conceptual analysis is one of my biggest interests, but precisely because of my work in other areas; the concepts I analyze reveal their complexity in multiple ways. A concept like "transparency" is not the same in AI as it is in cognitive science, neither is "accountability" the same in analytic philosophy as it is in public administration. Contemplating these semantic dynamics and their histories is a fascinating endeavor, and a critical step towards the eternal revision what "openness" means and what it could mean for the future of science and scientists.
