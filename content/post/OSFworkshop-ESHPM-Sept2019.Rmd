On September 24th I will give a workshop on how to use the Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io)), a collaborative web tool allowing scholars from all disciplines to upload and share the products of their research, e.g., data, materials, analysis protocols, and article preprints. 

I have already given a similar workshop at the [Faculty of Economics and Business Administration](https://www.ugent.be/eb/en) at Ghent University and the [Erasmus Research Institute of Management](https://www.erim.eur.nl) here at [EUR](https://www.eur.nl). This time I will be talking with researchers working at the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management ([ESHPM](https://www.eur.nl/eshpm/)). I was invited by [Dr. Pieter van Baal](https://www.eur.nl/people/pieter-van-baal), associate professor of Health Economics and Research Director at ESHPM. I believe this is a strong message: Dr. van Baal not only recognizes the importance of transparency in research, but he understands how crucial it is to provide researchers with user-friendly tools and practical support to facilitate a quicker transition to open science.

If you are working at ESHPM, I hope you will seize the opportunity and join us on September 24th for a couple of hours. It will be a very practical session: we will create a project, invite contributors, add subcomponents (e.g., data, materials), upload and visualize files, link other cloud services (e.g., [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), [figshare](https://figshare.com)), and much more. If you cannot participate, you can find the slides [here](https://osf.io/83u9x/). If you have any questions or need personalized advice, feel free to [contact me](mailto:schettino@eur.nl)!
