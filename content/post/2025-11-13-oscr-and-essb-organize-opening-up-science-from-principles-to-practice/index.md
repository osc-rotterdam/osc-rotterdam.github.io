<p>🎓 <b>OSCR and ESSB organize Opening Up Science: From Principles to Practice</b></p>

<p>📅 <b>4 December 2025 |14:00-15:30 | 🏫 Theil C1-6 </b></p>
<p>Join us for a special meeting of the <b>Open Science Community Rotterdam (OSCR)</b> in collaboration with the <b>Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences (ESSB)</b> during which <a href = "https://www.eur.nl/people/rolf-zwaan">Prof. dr. Rolf Zwaan</a> will share his extensive experience with open and responsible research practices and engage the audience in a discussion about the next steps in Open Science for their respective disciplines. </p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>In this talk, I will introduce the key principles and practices of Open Science, focusing on how researchers can make their work more transparent, reproducible, and accessible. I will discuss the motivation behind Open Science and outline practical steps for applying these principles in one’s own research. Topics include reproducibility and replication, preregistration and Registered Reports, and the various routes to Open Access publishing. I will also address how to deal with deviations from preregistration and how to implement a more open workflow using tools such as the Open Science Framework.</p>

<p>This event is open to both members and non-members of the Open Science Community Rotterdam (OSCR). Affiliation with the Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences (ESSB) is not required, although ESSB staff and students are particularly welcome to attend.</p>
