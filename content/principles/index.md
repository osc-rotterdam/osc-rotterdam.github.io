## Guiding Principles

* Open Science/Scholarship Communities (OSCs) are bottom-up platforms by and for researchers to exchange knowledge and know-how on open science practices
* OSCs are inclusive
    * Researchers are the target audience of OSCs, but students, researcher supporters, and others that are interested in (conducting) research are also welcome to join the community
    * No prior knowledge is required to be part of the community, nor are members in any way required to commit to certain open science/scholarship practices
* OSCs organize, promote, and facilitate open science/scholarship events to (1) learn about and discuss open science/scholarship practices; (2) share open science/scholarship knowledge; and (3) build professional networks
    * Events are open to members and non-members and, if possible, are free-of-charge
    * Attendees and organizers of events organized by OSCs must adhere to the [**Code of Conduct**](/coc/)
* OSCs promote critical discussions of pro’s and con’s of open science/scholarship practices. We refrain from being normative or condescending, and do not tell others what to do. Respect for each others’ workflows and decisions in this regard is critical

If there is no local OSC that you can join, we encourage you to start your own by following our [Starter Kit](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/7VEZ3).
