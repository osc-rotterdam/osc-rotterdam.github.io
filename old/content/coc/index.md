## Code of Conduct

OSCs organize, promote, and facilitate open science events to enable all participants, members and non-members, to learn about, share, and discuss open science practices. The purpose of this Code of Conduct (**CoC**) is to enable an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in mutual respect. We recognize a shared responsibility to create and maintain that environment for the benefit of all.

Some behaviors, therefore, are specifically prohibited **both in person and online**:

* Discriminating, racist, intimidating, harassing, lewd, demeaning, bullying, stalking, or threatening speech or
actions
* Any real or implied threat of physical harm
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Unwelcome physical contact
* Sustained disruption of speakers or events (verbally or physically)
* Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors
* Retaliation against an individual for participating in the investigation of a report of harassment or other
unacceptable behaviors
* Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors
* Falsely reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors

Critical examination of beliefs and viewpoints does not, by itself, constitute hostile conduct or harassment. Similarly, use of sexual imagery or language in the context of a professional discussion might not constitute hostile conduct or harassment if necessary to the topic of discussion.

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or if you believe a harassment problem exists, please report it as soon as possible to the OSCR Coordinator, [**Dr. Antonio Schettino**](mailto:schettino@eur.nl), either in person or electronically. If you prefer to remain anonymous, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FVHfUxHNCtZgMdRWoM7AUiR8r7CjuX3CFiCW2ZwWAtI/edit), which will be read by the OSCR Coordinator.

If you do not feel comfortable discussing your complaint with the OSCR Coordinator, you could approach the confidential advisor at EUR, [Mr. Martin Blok](mailto:blok@iss.nl), or any other confidential advisor in the [EUR network](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/hr/safe-and-healthy-work-environment/unwanted-conduct/contact). The target(s) of the complaint will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident. Every CoC violation report will be treated with seriousness and care.

### Enforcement

Participants who are asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. The Community Coordinator and event organizers retain the right to take appropriate actions, including:

* mediation between complainant(s) and alleged perpetrator(s), to reach an amicable resolution
* issue a verbal warning
* expel the offender(s) from the event (particularly if participants' immediate safety is threatened)
* expel the offender(s) from OSCR

The Community Coordinator and event organizers will also discuss with the complainant(s) whether they wish to contact the confidential advisor(s) at the affiliated University. The alleged perpetrator(s) will be notified of a complaint as soon as possible, and be given a chance to respond to the complaint.
