Research misconduct, such as fabrication, is a blatant violation of research integrity but uncommon. Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), on the other hand, are more common, pose less clear-cut ethical situations, and could nonetheless hamper the validity and trustworthiness of science. In this session, we will talk about possible QPRs in different stages of the research process, such as study design, data collection, and report writing. We will also go through some common situations that researchers face and how QRPs may arise in such situations. Possible ways of detecting and preventing QRPs in your research will be discussed.

This talk will be given by [Lorenza Dall'Aglio](https://twitter.com/L_DallAglio), [Bing Xu](https://twitter.com/BingXu_estella), and [Elisabet Blok](https://twitter.com/elisabetbl), coordinators of the [Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club](https://www.riotsciencenl.com/). They are PhD-students at Erasmus MC, within the Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychology and the Generation R Study group.

The event will take place on **March 18th 2021** at **15:00 CET** and will last 60'. An invitation email, including the Zoom link, meeting ID, and password, has been sent via the OSCR mailing list.
