Exciting news! **_OSCR_** will organize monthly journal clubs following the [ReproducibiliTea](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02842-8) format!

[Here](https://reproducibilitea.org/journal-clubs/#Rotterdam) you will find a brief description of how the **OSCR ReproducibiliTea** will be organized. In brief, each month we will meet for an hour either in **T** (_Mandeville_) or **J** (_Bayle_) building to discuss a paper or blog post treating a specific open science topic. Some examples may include:

- does publishing open access have specific costs and benefits for the individual researcher?
- what is the relationship between open science and privacy?
- is pre-publication peer-review an efficient and effective system to separate the wheat (valuable scientific contributions) from the chaff (pseudoscience)?
- how can confirmation bias be reduced when running empirical studies?

The materials of each session will be uploaded beforehand on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/yk9pf/). Each session will be led by a different discussant, who will quickly summarize the main message of the document before the open discussion. If you want to propose a paper, please [contact me](mailto:schettino@eur.nl).

The first ReproducibiliTea meet-up will take place on November 13th. I will be the discussant, and we will talk about the following paper:

> Munafò, M. R., Nosek, B. A., Bishop, D. V. M., Button, K. S., Chambers, C. D., du Sert, N. P., … Ioannidis, J. P. A. (2017). A manifesto for reproducible science. Nature Human Behaviour, 1(1), s41562-016-0021–016. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021)

Today (Oct. 21st, 2019) a first introductory email was sent to part of the researchers' community at EUR. If you have not received it, please contact me and I will be happy to include you in the mailing list.

Hope to see you there!

Antonio Schettino
