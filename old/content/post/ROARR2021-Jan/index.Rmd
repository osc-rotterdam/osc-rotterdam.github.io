Are you curious to hear about what can go wrong in science, but more importantly what we can do to improve our current scientific practice? In this talk, after a brief reminder on the credibility revolution, we will explain what open research is and what it can do for you, but also for the scientific community at large. Lastly, we will specifically focus on two open research practices which are key to achieving better scientific output when testing hypotheses: Preregistration and Registered Reports.

This talk will be given by [Lorenza Dall'Aglio](https://twitter.com/L_DallAglio), [Bing Xu](https://twitter.com/BingXu_estella), and [Elisabet Blok](https://twitter.com/elisabetbl), coordinators of the [Rotterdam R.I.O.T. Science Club](https://www.riotsciencenl.com/). They are PhD-students at Erasmus MC, within the Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychology and the Generation R Study group.

The event will take place on **January 28th 2021** at **15:00 CET** and will last 60'. An invitation email, including the Zoom link, meeting ID, and password, has been sent via the OSCR mailing list. If you are not part of the mailing list but would like to join, please contact [Antonio](mailto:schettino@eur.nl).
