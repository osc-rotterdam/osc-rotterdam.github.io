The fifth OSCR [**ReproducibiliTea journal club**](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/) will take place on **March 11th** at **11:00** in **room G2-35** ([G building](https://www.eur.nl/en/campus/locations/spaces/g-building)).

We will have a special guest: [Hardy Schwamm](https://libereurope.eu/blog/dt_team/hardy-schwamm/), Open Scholarship Librarian at the [National University of Ireland](http://www.nuigalway.ie/) and co-founder of the [Open Scholarship Community Galway](http://www.osc-galway.ie/). Hardy is interested in how research is evaluated and how academics are assessed when it comes to job / grant applications and promotions. Hardy believes that research assessment is a topic all researchers should have a basic knowledge of, as it will determine their careers in academia.

In this context, we will look at the blog post [**Introducing SCOPE – a process for evaluating responsibly**](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/introducing-scope-aprocess-for-evaluating-responsibly/), published by [Laura Himanen](https://fi.linkedin.com/in/laura-himanen-851a7b1a) and [Elizabeth Gadd](https://about.me/elizabeth.gadd) on [The Bibliomagician](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/) in December 2019. The blog post asks what universities do next, once Responsible Metrics statements such as [DORA](https://sfdora.org/) are signed? How can we measure researchers’ outputs in a way that takes into account all the problematic aspects of research metrics? The proposed SCOPE method aims to be a step in this direction.  We will go through SCOPE[^1] and discuss if such a method speaks to researchers and should be promoted to senior managers in universities.

In preparation for this meeting, have a look at the [SCOPE blog post](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/introducing-scope-aprocess-for-evaluating-responsibly/) and think about how research is currently evaluated at EUR and other universities you know.

An invitation on _Outlook_ calendar has been sent to researchers in the ReproducibiliTea mailing list (if you want to be included, contact [Antonio](mailto:schettino@eur.nl). Please explicitly **Accept** or **Decline** the invitation, so that catering and room capacity can be evaluated accordingly.

## Next Meeting

The next meeting will take place on **April 8th 2020** at **11:00** in **room J7-55** ([Bayle building](https://www.eur.nl/en/campus/locations/spaces/bayle-building)). We will have another special guest... stay tuned!

Greetings,

Hardy Schwamm and Antonio Schettino
