<p>It is unfortunate that most of our scientific fields have to deal with <strong>publication bias</strong>, a phenomenon that occurs when the results of a study influences the chances of being published. In other words, when you find significant results (e.g., significant <em>p</em>-values from your statistical analysis), there is a higher chance of publication. This has implications for our professional career: when you have more and interesting publications, you have higher chances of fruitful collaborations or receive more funding, better academic positions, etc.</p>
<p>Publication bias taints our field: it imbalances findings (null results are not published) despite our thorough attempts to improve theories, methods, experimental designs, and analyses. It also influences our behavior as researchers: it could lead to questionable research practices (e.g. <em>p</em>-hacking) that scientists (unconsciously) perform to increase their chances of getting significant results. This is, of course, unethical.</p>
<p>By compiling studies in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we are able to examine and account for publication bias. A relative new statistical tool to investigate selective reporting of significant results is <strong><em>p</em>-curve analysis</strong>. In this talk, <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2021/03/03/lutz-landesbergen/">Miranda Lutz-Landesbergen</a> (third year PhD candidate in clinical psychology at ESSB) will give a talk about publication bias and how to investigate it in meta-analyses. Also, she will introduce and demonstrate <em>p</em>-curve analysis with a publication and her own data, in R and with an online tool. She will provide relevant literature and recommendations for you as a researcher to combat publication bias. With this talk, she hopes you will become familiar to this analysis and be encouraged to think critically about selective reporting of <em>p</em>-values in your field of research<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
