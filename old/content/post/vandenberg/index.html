<div id="description" class="section level1">
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>You might have seen my name pop up as Chair of the <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/about-eur/organisation-administration/participation/university-council/who-we-are">University Council</a> at Erasmus University Rotterdam. But besides this role I also teach as a tutor at the Department of Public Administration and Sociology.</p>
<p>Over the past years my interests in International and European Governance grew towards the field of diplomacy and specifically international negotiation. In 2018 I founded <a href="https://www.youngdiplomat.org/">The Young Diplomat</a>, the idea is to allow students and young professionals from every background to gain essential skills and grow their network. Because in order to achieve a more equal, just and inclusive world, people from all different social economic backgrounds need to have the same opportunities and access to networks and skills development. I am especially interested in and focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political and Diplomatic strategy (development and application)</li>
<li>(International) Negotiation, with a focus on applying strategies through the use of soft and hard power</li>
<li>Operational Codes, a method of analysis of actors, institutions, or states to better understand their actions, positions, strategies, approach to problems and how they develop solutions</li>
<li>Agenda setting and policy development within institutional processes, especially within the European Union, the United Nations, and NATO</li>
</ul>
