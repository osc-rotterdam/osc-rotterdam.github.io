<p>After the summer break, the tenth <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2019/10/announcement-reproducibilitea/"><strong>OSCR ReproducibiliTea journal club</strong></a> will take place on <strong>September 23th</strong> at <strong>14:00</strong>. I will be the discussant, and we will talk about the following paper<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wicherts, J. M., Veldkamp, C. L. S., Augusteijn, H. E. M., Bakker, M., van Aert, R. C. M., &amp; van Assen, M. A. L. M. (2016). Degrees of Freedom in Planning, Running, Analyzing, and Reporting Psychological Studies: A Checklist to Avoid p-Hacking. Frontiers in Psychology, 7, 1832. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01832" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01832</a></p>

<p>This paper presents a list of 34 degrees of freedom<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> that researchers often encounter when planning, analyzing, and reporting the results of empirical studies. This list can be used not only to assess the transparency and trustworthiness of papers in the literature, but also to carefully evaluate one’s own biases and behaviors when conducting research. Last but not least, such a handy checklist can be proactively used as a blueprint when creating a comprehensive preregistration document as well as evaluating the quality of others’ preregistrations.</p>
<p>Although written with psychologists as the main target audience, this checklist can be applied in many other quantitative disciplines that analyze data within the null-hypothesis statistical framework (and mainly use <em>p</em>-values), and adapting it to fit other (statistical) methodologies is also possible. Attendees will be encouraged to examine the checklist and reflect on how it could help them in their own studies.</p>
