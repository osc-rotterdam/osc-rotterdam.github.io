<p>On September 24th I will give a workshop on how to use the Open Science Framework (<a href="https://osf.io">OSF</a>), a collaborative web tool allowing scholars from all disciplines to upload and share the products of their research, e.g., data, materials, analysis protocols, and article preprints.</p>
<p>I have already given a similar workshop at the <a href="https://www.ugent.be/eb/en">Faculty of Economics and Business Administration</a> at Ghent University and the <a href="https://www.erim.eur.nl">Erasmus Research Institute of Management</a> here at <a href="https://www.eur.nl">EUR</a>. This time I will be talking with researchers working at the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (<a href="https://www.eur.nl/eshpm/">ESHPM</a>). I was invited by <a href="https://www.eur.nl/people/pieter-van-baal">Dr. Pieter van Baal</a>, associate professor of Health Economics and Research Director at ESHPM. I believe this is a strong message: Dr. van Baal not only recognizes the importance of transparency in research, but he understands how crucial it is to provide researchers with user-friendly tools and practical support to facilitate a quicker transition to open science.</p>
<p>If you are working at ESHPM, I hope you will seize the opportunity and join us on September 24th for a couple of hours. It will be a very practical session: we will create a project, invite contributors, add subcomponents (e.g., data, materials), upload and visualize files, link other cloud services (e.g., <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com">figshare</a>), and much more. If you cannot participate, you can find the slides <a href="https://osf.io/83u9x/">here</a>. If you have any questions or need personalized advice, feel free to <a href="mailto:schettino@eur.nl">contact me</a>!</p>
