<p>Projects can be hard to manage sometimes and you may want to resort to older versions of the code you wrote for your project without having to create file copies all the time. This can especially be cumbersome when your collaborators want to access your code or run it on their data. This is where <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> comes in, an open-source distributed version control system that allows you to create a timeline of your code so that you can seamlessly resort back to earlier versions. It does this in a way that allows you to easily collaborate with other researchers, even if both of you are working on changes to the same files.</p>
<p>This talk will be given by <a href="https://twitter.com/eloygeenjaar">Eloy Geenjaar</a>, a double degree MSc student at the Delft University of Technology and Engineering Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/groups/kinder-neuroimaging-centrum-rotterdam-knicr">KNICR lab</a> at the ErasmusMC. Eloy is finishing his thesis at the <a href="https://trendscenter.org/">TReNDS center</a> as a Graduate Research Assistant. His research focuses on the extraction of meaningful representations from fMRI, using deep learning techniques.</p>
<p>The event will take place on <strong>February 12th 2021</strong> at <strong>15:00 CET</strong> and will last 90â€™.
